# Q-A-Chatbot

## Overview

This project implements a Question-Answering chatbot using Python. It leverages several libraries, including Langchain, ChromaDB, and OpenAI, to provide intelligent responses to user queries based on a given knowledge base. The application is built using FastAPI and Streamlit for the backend and frontend, respectively.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Suborno-Deb-Bappon/Q-A-Chatbot.git
    cd Q-A-Chatbot
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your OpenAI API key:**

    You'll need an OpenAI API key to use the chatbot. Set it as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    ```
    Or, you can set the API key in `.env` file
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following line:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Backend (FastAPI)

To start the backend server:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the FastAPI application, which handles the chatbot logic.  The API will typically be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Running the Frontend (Streamlit)

To launch the Streamlit-based chatbot interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will open the chatbot interface in your web browser. You can then interact with the chatbot by typing your questions in the chat window.

## Project Structure

*   `app.py`: Contains the Streamlit application for the chatbot interface.
*   `main.py`: Implements the FastAPI backend, including API endpoints for handling questions.
*   `query.py`: Handles the logic for querying the knowledge base using Langchain and ChromaDB.
*   `chroma_db/`: Likely contains the ChromaDB database files.
*   `docs/`:  Potentially contains documentation files (though currently empty).
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `.devcontainer/`: Contains configuration for a development container (if using VS Code Dev Containers).
*   `__pycache__/`: Contains compiled Python files.

## Features

*   **Question Answering:** Provides answers to user questions based on a loaded knowledge base.
*   **Langchain Integration:** Uses Langchain for managing the language model and question-answering pipeline.
*   **ChromaDB:** Utilizes ChromaDB as a vector store for efficient similarity search and retrieval of relevant information.
*   **OpenAI Integration:**  Leverages OpenAI's language models for generating responses.
*   **Streamlit Interface:** Offers a user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the chatbot.
*   **FastAPI Backend:** Provides a robust and scalable backend for handling API requests.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following main libraries (see `requirements.txt` for a complete list):

*   `fastapi`: For building the API.
*   `streamlit`: For creating the chat interface.
*   `langchain`: For managing the language model and pipeline.
*   `chromadb`: For vector storage.
*   `openai`: For accessing OpenAI's language models.
*   `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Further Development

This project provides a basic framework for a question-answering chatbot.  Potential areas for improvement and expansion include:

*   **Data Ingestion:** Implement more robust methods for loading and processing data into the knowledge base.
*   **Context Management:** Improve the chatbot's ability to maintain context across multiple turns of conversation.
*   **Error Handling:** Add more comprehensive error handling and logging.
*   **API Enhancements:** Extend the API with additional functionalities, such as user authentication and data management.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** Enhance the user interface with features like message history, user settings, and visual feedback.
*   **Evaluation Metrics**: Add metrics to evaluate the chatbot's performance.
